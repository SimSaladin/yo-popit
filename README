PVL yo-popit
============

Requirements
------------

- mpd (recent enough: with http streaming support)
- mplayer (to get the lengths of songs)


Fetching music from a samba share
---------------------------------

To fetch music files from a samba share:
   
   > cd /opt/pvl-mpd/music
   > mkdir K13 # change this!
   > cd K13
   > smbclient -U<username> //netdisk/work <password>
   > smb: \> prompt
   > smb: \> cd YO-popit-K13 # change!
   > smb: \> mget *
   > smb: \> quit
   > mpc update

Constructing a playlist
-----------------------

First, make sure you have file named silence.m3u in the root (/opt/pvl-mpd).
This file should be a playlist file, which plays 1 HOUR of silence. For example
if you have 5 minutes long silence.mp3 in /opt/pvl-mpd/music, the contents of
the silence.m3u would be 12 lines identical to this:

   /opt/pvl-mpd/music/silence.mp3

Now run the playlist generator script and see the example(s):

   > cd /opt/pvl-mpd
   > ./generate-playlist.sh --help
   WARNING: no silence.m3u file

   generate_playlist.sh [options] DIRECTORY [args]

   DIRECTORY should point to the files to randomize among.

   options:
     --debug     | Run in debug mode.
     --help, -h  | Show this help.

   arguments:
     --last,    -l FILE  | Append a song last.
     --first,   -f FILE  | Insert a song to the beginning.
     --require, -r FILE  | Require a file included.

   example:
     generate_playlist.sh ./music --last final_countdown.flac

   known bugs:  !! IMPORTANT !!
     * remember to pass at least one --first or --last, or a awk will
       fail in a mystic manner :)

Timing the stream
-----------------

Create a crontab file. In the crontab file the 1 hour of silence should be
noted - In this example the silence begin playing at 7:00 and the actual music
at 8:00. The command is the name of the playlist relative to playlists/.

   0 7 * * 1 playlist.m3u

Then run the `set-wakes.sh` script with the created file as argument. This
script performs checks:

   - playlist exists
   - every song on the playlist exists
